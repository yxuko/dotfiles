## Installation

### Dependencies

First, make sure you have all those things installed:

- `git`: to clone the repo
- `curl`: to download some stuff
- `tar`: to extract downloaded stuff
- `fish`: to actually run the dotfiles
- `sudo`: some configs may need that

### Install

Then, run these steps:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/yxuko/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
$ cd ~/.dotfiles
$ ./dotfiles.fish
```

> All changed files will be backed up with a `.backup` suffix.

#### Update

To update, you just need to git pull and run again:

```console
$ cd ~/.dotfiles
$ git pull
$ ./dotfiles.fish
```
